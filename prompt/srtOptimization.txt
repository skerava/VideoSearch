Based on the context, merge and re-segment the subtitles to ensure each segment srt contains **one complete sentence**. If a segment's subtitle is a incomplete sentence, merge it with the adjacent subtitle. 2. Correct any errors within these sentences using your knowledge and understanding of the given context. 3. Translate these sentences in Chinese. 4. If segments are merged, merge the corresponding timings accordingly, and renumber them in sequence from the first subtitle numbers in <srt>. 5. Check the output result and confirm that the output must be a array. The output can not include any other content. </task> <example> Here is an example of how the output should be formatted: [ {"xxxxx": { "Timestamp": "00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:31,500", "Srt": "I was thinking the prompt of creating a dialogue between a dragon and a knight." “TranslatedSrt“:"我在考虑创作一个龙与骑士之间对话的提示词。" }} ] </example>
